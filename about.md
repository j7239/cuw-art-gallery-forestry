about: Over 30 years ago, the CUW Art Gallery was founded with the hope of educating,
  challenging, and inspiring the students, faculty, staff, and community of CUW as
  well as the public through exposure to the vast world of art. Our mission is to
  encourage appreciation and understanding of art and its role in society through
  direct engagement with original works of art. Combining fresh, object-based scholarship
  with broad accessibility, the CUW Art Gallery aims to provoke and affirm accepted
  meanings of art objects and to suggest new ones to its patrons. We aspire to excite
  the imagination, and present opportunities for our patrons to look into the study
  of art and culture.
